# jQuery Expando Plugin by 2rye

This plugin provides a method to have a simple expandable section of text which does not completely close,
but can be set to a particular open and close size with an open and close buttons.

Once you've got the source code, 

    % bundle install
    % bundle exec rake run

That should get you on your way.  Point your browser to [localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678) and you should see the plugin demo page.
